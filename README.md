## Key Takeaways from This Exercise

- **HTML Structure** – I learned how to organize content with semantic HTML elements, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`. 
- **CSS Flexbox Layout** – I used Flexbox, which helped me create responsive navigation bars, align profile images with text, and arrange elements horizontally.
- **Styling with CSS** - I implemented hover effects, drop shadows, and glow animations to enhance user experience. I had fun experimenting with these.
